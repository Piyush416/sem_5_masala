     - SQL (basic queries, joins, CRUD operations)
     - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): executing queries, connection pooling
     - ORM basics with Hibernate (optional at this stage)
   - Resources: MySQL/PostgreSQL tutorials, JDBC documentation.

5. Spring Framework (Weeks 17-24)
   - Objective: Master the most popular Java web development framework.
   - Topics:
     - Spring Core (Dependency Injection, Beans)
     - Spring MVC (controllers, view resolvers)
     - Spring Boot (auto-configuration, embedded servers)
     - REST APIs with Spring Boot
     - Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate)
   - Resources: "Spring in Action" by Craig Walls, official Spring documentation.

6. Version Control (Week 25)

     - Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

9. Hands-on Projects (Ongoing)
   - Objective: Build real-world projects to apply your knowledge.
   - Ideas:
     - Personal blog (using Servlets/JSP)
     - E-commerce site (using Spring Boot, REST API)
     - User authentication system (Spring Security)

10. Interview Preparation (Ongoing)
   - Practice coding problems on LeetCode, HackerRank
   - Learn about design patterns, algorithms, and system design
   - Mock interviews for technical skills and problem-solving
